#*BRIGID*

_Brigid is the Celtic god of knowledge and wisdom_

Accepts an audit log in stdin and emits an un-opaqued version to stdout.

This scripts requires access to a postgreSQL database. You will need to install libpg-dev
onto your linux system. libpg-dev is the C library interface to postgreSQL.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

Then you will require the GEM to interface with this shared library:

```shell
$ sudo gem install pg
```

Should be that simple.
